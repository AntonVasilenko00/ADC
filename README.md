This is a "test task" (Home page of a company) I made , trying to apply for a job to a local employee, but failed due to spending too much time on development.

Developing the Website, I implemented and practiced ***such skills and technologies as***:

**Responsiveness(Flexbox, Media queries), SCSS(mixins,variables, etc.), Relative units(rem,em), Custom checkboxes, Some simple js Sliders**
